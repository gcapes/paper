# Abstract
This paper describes the method for creating viruses that exterminate over 99.99 percent of the world population.

# Introduction
Killing people is fun (Jones et al. 1998)

The research is motivated by the recent studies from the darkest alleys of dark-net.

# Simulations
We simulate the spread of virus and it kills everyone in a week. The only person surviving is Putin. How weird.

# Methodology
We create the virus by combining the source-code from open-software section of the Marvel franchise Mutants with a random text string typed by a monkey.

# Results
We deployed the virus and it worked as in the simulation. Putin is feeling very well despite all his neighbours died. We suspect the third author had something to do wit it.
